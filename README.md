Project Title
---------------
Comparing the Effectiveness of K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees in Predicting Whether a User Will Rate a Book as Top-Rated

Descriptions
---------------
This code analyses book ratings from three datasets (BX-Books.csv, BX-Ratings.csv, BX-Users.csv).
It prepreprocesses the data to clean any anomalies and enhance the data consistency.
Few statistical analysis has been done by visuaising various data distributions.
Machine learning models (K Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees) are then built to predict rating classification. 
Various performance metrics are then computed as the base of comparison for the two models.
